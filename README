A small utility that helps calculating memory spaces.
It uses readline to get user input, and muparser to parse the expresssion.
The following postfixes are supported:
k = 1000
M = 1000*1000
G = 1000*1000*1000

kb = 1024
mb = 1024*1024
gb = 1024*1024*1024

It supports:
+, -, *, /, %, >>, <<, &, |, &&, ||, <. >, <=, >=, ==, ^

To reuse result, you can use the variable ans.
